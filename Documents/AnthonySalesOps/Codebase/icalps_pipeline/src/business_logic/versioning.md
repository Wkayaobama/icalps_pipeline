Planning Phase

  

Analyze my feature request and create a project file with  in github  from now on populate issues that  describes :

- What the workflow should do

- How it starts (trigger)

- Step-by-step process

- What services it connects to

- What the output should be

- What could go wrong


Creating the tasks as issues
Use project for visual representation of the tasks + management
and create property at the project level that incorporate start date end date label and criticality

1. Creating an issue

Example of issue : Set up pipeline for data extraction,create a by step plan of the action to undertake, model business rules pertaining to deal stage changes

tasks are typically assigned to me 

labels can be customized based one one's workflow and don't bother with it
(ex : feature ,documentation,bug)

Remeber that labels should apply to the issue level 

I don't mind Conventionnal commits  neither do I bother about CI/CD for now

However in the future 
Dependency chart / Kanban is also useful / Lean management (see the engineering toolbox)

A project can encompass multiple repository and present in several ways (kanban,gantt,table/board) but in our case it will be mainly tied to the crm one


Retroactively Think hard about the steps we did and how to integrate within a streamlined project planner
Note : Project management can be streamlined with the llm tool


1. Populating a project template

Either add issue, or create from a dictionnary

each project setting must incorporate field pertaining to start date and end date
